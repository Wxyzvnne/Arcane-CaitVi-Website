  <h2>📖 Fan Novel: Shattered Boundaries</h2>
  <p>
    In this original fan novel, Caitlyn and Vi must uncover a hidden
    Hextech conspiracy linking Piltover’s council to Zaun’s shimmer trade.
    As trust deepens and danger escalates, their bond evolves from uneasy
    partnership into something far more powerful.

  <div class="novel-box">
    <h4>Chapter I: Sparks in the Undercity</h4>
    <p>
      The air in Zaun burned with shimmer fumes. Caitlyn steadied her rifle,
      heart racing. Somewhere in the shadows, Vi watched her — not as an enemy,
      but as someone worth protecting.
